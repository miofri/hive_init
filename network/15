# Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

# we can edit the /etc/hosts file so that 46.19.122.85 will corresponds to
# intra.42.fr. It is due to a process called local DNS lookup, which lets
# our computer find the IP address of a site without needing to find it in
# an external server.
# add this line to /etc/hosts: 46.19.122.85 intra.42.fr .
