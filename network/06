# The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. When users
# type domain names such as ‘google.com’ or ‘nytimes.com’ into web browsers,
# DNS is responsible for finding the correct IP address for those sites.
# Browsers then use those addresses to communicate with origin servers or
# CDN edge servers to access website information. This all happens thanks
# to DNS servers: machines dedicated to answering DNS queries.
